/// A scrollable, 2D array of widgets placed according to the masonry layout.
///
/// The main axis direction of a grid is the direction in which it scrolls (the
/// [scrollDirection]).
///
/// The most commonly used grid layouts are [MasonryGridView.count], which
/// creates a layout with a fixed number of tiles in the cross axis, and
/// [MasonryGridView.extent], which creates a layout with tiles that have a
/// maximum cross-axis extent. A custom [SliverSimpleGridDelegate] can produce
/// an arbitrary 2D arrangement of children.
///
/// To create a grid with a large (or infinite) number of children, use the
/// [MasonryGridView.builder] constructor with either a
/// [SliverSimpleGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount] or a
/// [SliverSimpleGridDelegateWithMaxCrossAxisExtent] for the [gridDelegate].
///
/// To use a custom [SliverChildDelegate], use [MasonryGridView.custom].
///
/// To create a linear array of children, use a [ListView].
///
/// To control the initial scroll offset of the scroll view, provide a
/// [controller] with its [ScrollController.initialScrollOffset] property set.
///
/// ## Transitioning to [CustomScrollView]
///
/// A [MasonryGridView] is basically a [CustomScrollView] with a single
/// [SliverMasonryGrid] in its [CustomScrollView.slivers] property.
///
/// If [MasonryGridView] is no longer sufficient, for example because the scroll
/// view is to have both a grid and a list, or because the grid is to be
/// combined with a [SliverAppBar], etc, it is straight-forward to port code
/// from using [MasonryGridView] to using [CustomScrollView] directly.
///
/// The [key], [scrollDirection], [reverse], [controller], [primary], [physics],
/// and [shrinkWrap] properties on [MasonryGridView] map directly to the
/// identically named properties on [CustomScrollView].
///
/// The [CustomScrollView.slivers] property should be a list containing just a
/// [SliverMasonryGrid].
///
/// The [childrenDelegate] property on [MasonryGridView] corresponds to the
/// [SliverMultiBoxAdaptorWidget.delegate] property, and the [gridDelegate]
/// property on the [MasonryGridView] corresponds to the
/// [SliverMasonryGrid.gridDelegate] property.
///
/// The [MasonryGridView], [MasonryGridView.count], and [MasonryGridView.extent]
/// constructors' `children` arguments correspond to the [childrenDelegate]
/// being a [SliverChildListDelegate] with that same argument. The
/// [MasonryGridView.builder] constructor's `itemBuilder` and `childCount`
/// arguments correspond to the [childrenDelegate] being a
/// [SliverChildBuilderDelegate] with the matching arguments.
///
/// The [MasonryGridView.count] and [MasonryGridView.extent] constructors create
/// custom grid delegates, and have equivalently named constructors on
/// [SliverMasonryGrid] to ease the transition: [SliverMasonryGrid.count] and
/// [SliverMasonryGrid.extent] respectively.
///
/// The [padding] property corresponds to having a [SliverPadding] in the
/// [CustomScrollView.slivers] property instead of the grid itself, and having
/// the [SliverGrid] instead be a child of the [SliverPadding].
///
/// Once code has been ported to use [CustomScrollView], other slivers, such as
/// [SliverList] or [SliverAppBar], can be put in the [CustomScrollView.slivers]
/// list.
///
/// By default, [MasonryGridView] will automatically pad the limits of the
/// grids's scrollable to avoid partial obstructions indicated by
/// [MediaQuery]'s padding. To avoid this behavior, override with a
/// zero [padding] property.
