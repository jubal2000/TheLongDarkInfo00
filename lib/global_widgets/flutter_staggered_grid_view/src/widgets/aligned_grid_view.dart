/// A scrollable, 2D array of widgets placed according to the aligned layout.
///
/// The main axis direction of a grid is the direction in which it scrolls (the
/// [scrollDirection]).
///
/// The most commonly used grid layouts are [AlignedGridView.count], which
/// creates a layout with a fixed number of tiles in the cross axis, and
/// [AlignedGridView.extent], which creates a layout with tiles that have a
/// maximum cross-axis extent. A custom [SliverSimpleGridDelegate] can produce
/// an arbitrary 2D arrangement of children.
///
/// To create a linear array of children, use a [ListView].
///
/// To control the initial scroll offset of the scroll view, provide a
/// [controller] with its [ScrollController.initialScrollOffset] property set.
///
/// ## Transitioning to [CustomScrollView]
///
/// A [AlignedGridView] is basically a [CustomScrollView] with a single
/// [SliverAlignedGrid] in its [CustomScrollView.slivers] property.
///
/// If [AlignedGridView] is no longer sufficient, for example because the scroll
/// view is to have both a grid and a list, or because the grid is to be
/// combined with a [SliverAppBar], etc, it is straight-forward to port code
/// from using [AlignedGridView] to using [CustomScrollView] directly.
///
/// The [key], [scrollDirection], [reverse], [controller], [primary], [physics],
/// and [shrinkWrap] properties on [AlignedGridView] map directly to the
/// identically named properties on [CustomScrollView].
///
/// The [CustomScrollView.slivers] property should be a list containing just a
/// [SliverAlignedGrid].
///
/// The [AlignedGridView.count] and [AlignedGridView.extent] constructors create
/// custom grid delegates, and have equivalently named constructors on
/// [SliverAlignedGrid] to ease the transition: [SliverAlignedGrid.count] and
/// [SliverAlignedGrid.extent] respectively.
///
/// The [padding] property corresponds to having a [SliverPadding] in the
/// [CustomScrollView.slivers] property instead of the grid itself, and having
/// the [SliverGrid] instead be a child of the [SliverPadding].
///
/// Once code has been ported to use [CustomScrollView], other slivers, such as
/// [SliverList] or [SliverAppBar], can be put in the [CustomScrollView.slivers]
/// list.
///
/// By default, [AlignedGridView] will automatically pad the limits of the
/// grids's scrollable to avoid partial obstructions indicated by
/// [MediaQuery]'s padding. To avoid this behavior, override with a
/// zero [padding] property.
